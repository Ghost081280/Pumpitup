# Song Investment App

A Flask-based web application where users can upload songs and invest in them using Solana cryptocurrency.

## Overview

This application enables users to:
- Sign in using their Solana wallet
- Upload music files (MP3 or WAV formats)
- View a list of all uploaded songs with investment details
- Invest in songs using Solana

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users sign in via their Solana wallet address.
- **Song Management:** Upload, view, and download songs.
- **Investments:** Users can invest Solana in songs, similar to how one might invest in memes on platforms like pump.fun.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- A Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom for testing on devnet)
- Access to a Solana RPC node (e.g., devnet for development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd song_investment_app

Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the project directory and add:
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com  # Use devnet for testing
Run the Application:
bash
python song_investment_app.py

Development Notes
Database: SQLite for simplicity; consider using PostgreSQL or MySQL for production.
Security: The current setup uses a placeholder for Solana transactions. In production, implement client-side transaction signing.
File Storage: Files are stored locally; for scalability, consider using cloud storage solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

Usage
Sign In: Use your Solana wallet address to sign in.
Upload Song: Navigate to the upload endpoint to share your music.
Invest: Choose a song and invest by specifying an amount in SOL.

**Notes:**
- Replace `[your-repository-url]` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
- Adjust the license according to your project's needs. Common choices include MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL if you want to share your code with others.
- The `.env` file setup is suggested for managing environment variables, which is a good practice for keeping sensitive information out of your codebase. Make sure to exclude `.env` from version control by adding it to `.gitignore`.
